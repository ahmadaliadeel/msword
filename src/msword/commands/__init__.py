"""Commands package — single source of truth for document mutation.

Per the spec (§3 architecture), **commands are the only way views and tools
mutate the `Document`**. This is a project-wide invariant enforced by
convention: any code path that changes model state must do so by constructing
a `Command` subclass and pushing it onto the document's `UndoStack`. Views
and tools observe the document via Qt signals; they never write to it
directly.

This package is allowed to import Qt (`PySide6.QtGui.QUndoCommand`,
`PySide6.QtCore.QUndoStack`); model packages are not.

Public surface:

- `Command` — base class wrapping `QUndoCommand`. Subclasses implement
  `_do` / `_undo` and override `text()`.
- `UndoStack` — thin wrapper around `QUndoStack` exposing the only API
  views/tools should call (`push`, `undo`, `redo`, `begin_macro`,
  `end_macro`, `clear`, plus `index_changed` and `clean_changed` signals).
- `MacroCommand` — composite command that runs a list of sub-commands
  forward and reverses them on undo. Useful when `begin_macro` /
  `end_macro` aren't sufficient (e.g. constructing a single command that
  itself contains an ordered batch).
- Concrete commands for pages and frames (see `page` and `frame` modules).

Concrete commands hold a strong reference to the `Document` rather than a
weak reference. Documents are the long-lived owners of their undo stack
(commands sit on `doc.undo_stack`); a command can never outlive its
document, so the strong-ref keeps the type signature simple and avoids the
ergonomic cost of `weakref.proxy` indirection on the hot path.
